# E-commerce Customer Segmentation using RFM & Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Customer Segmentation** using **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) combined with **unsupervised machine learning algorithms** such as **Agglomerative Clustering**.

The goal is to help a business understand customer behavior and divide customers into meaningful groups so that the company can make **data-driven marketing and business decisions**.

## Business Problem
Businesses often treat all customers the same, which can lead to:

- Unnecessary marketing costs
- Poor customer retention
- Missed opportunities to upsell or re-engage valuable customers

Customer segmentation solves these problems by identifying:

- Most valuable customers
- Inactive customers
- Customers to target with discounts or offers
- Where to focus marketing budget

## Data Preprocessing
Steps performed:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, fixed missing values, corrected datatypes
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated RFM values, standardized features
- **EDA:** Checked distributions, identified patterns and outliers

## Clustering Method
- **Agglomerative Clustering:** Chosen for its hierarchical nature and interpretability  
- **Segments Created:**  
  - Low-Value / One-Time Buyers  
  - Potential Loyalists  
  - Champions  
  - Loyal Customers  

## Segment Insights
- Each segment is profiled based on **Recency, Frequency, Monetary** values  
- Visualizations include 3D scatter plots, treemaps, line charts for monthly revenue

## Conclusion
The segmentation allows the business to **focus marketing efforts**, identify high-value customers, and optimize revenue. Using **Agglomerative Clustering**, the company can clearly differentiate customer groups and take **data-driven actions**.
